# g2g-py
To start for dummies:

We need to work in a virtual environment to ensure all our downloaded modules are in the same spot so we can keep track of them (rather than downloading them onto your PC).

`
.venv\Scripts\activate
`

Once the virtual environment has been activated,

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

and because my app likes to act up, please run this from the command line using

`
python main.py
`
