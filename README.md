To start for dummies:

We need to work in a virtual environment to ensure all our downloaded modules are in the same spot so we can keep track of them (rather than downloading them onto your PC).

'''
.venv\Scripts\activate
'''

Once the virtual environment has been activated,

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
